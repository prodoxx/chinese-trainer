## üé¨ Opening - App Introduction (45 seconds)

[Show Danbing homepage with dark theme and mascot]

**"Welcome to Danbing - the revolutionary Traditional Chinese learning platform that helps you master characters 10x faster using cutting-edge AI and proven learning science."**

[Presenter notes: Highlight the professional dark theme, show the mascot prominently]

**"Unlike traditional flashcards or textbook methods, Danbing combines 50+ years of memory research with artificial intelligence to create the most efficient character learning system ever built. You'll study just 8 characters in 90-second sessions, with 85% retention rates proven by our science-based approach."**

[Show key metrics on homepage: "90-second sessions, 8 characters, 85% retention"]

**"Let's dive in and see exactly how this works."**

## üöÄ User Onboarding Journey (60 seconds)

### Account Setup & First Impression
[Show signup form]

**"Getting started is simple. Create your free account - no credit card required - and you get a full 14-day Pro trial with 2,000 AI credits."**

[Show email verification screen]

**"After quick email verification, you're immediately taken to your dashboard. Notice how clean and focused this is - we've designed every interface to minimize cognitive load and keep you focused on learning."**

### CSV Import Magic
[Show empty dashboard with "Import Your First Deck" button]

**"Here's where the magic begins. Most apps make you create cards manually. Danbing revolutionizes this - just upload a simple CSV file with one character per line."**

[Demonstrate drag & drop CSV upload]

**"I'm uploading 15 characters from my HSK study list. Watch what happens next..."**

[Show real-time enrichment progress bar]

**"Danbing's AI automatically enriches each character with:**
- Dictionary lookup from 123,557 Traditional Chinese entries
- Taiwan Mandarin pronunciation with authentic accents
- AI-generated contextual images for visual memory
- Deep linguistic analysis, etymology, and mnemonics
- Audio synthesis using Microsoft Azure's Taiwan voice"**

[Show progress: "Enriching your deck... 12/15 - Dictionary lookup ‚úì, AI pronunciation ‚úì, Contextual images ‚úì, AI insights generation ‚è≥"]

**"In just 2-3 minutes, what would take hours manually is done automatically with professional quality."**

## üß† Core Learning System - Flash Sessions (90 seconds)

### Interactive Demo System
[Show deck overview with stats]

**"Here's your enriched deck. Notice the progress tracking - 15 characters, all enriched. For new users, we provide an interactive demo that explains the science behind our system."**

[Trigger demo modal]

**"This isn't just another flashcard app. Our dual-phase system is based on dual-coding theory and attention research."**

[Show demo slide with ASCII diagram]

**"Each 90-second session presents 8 characters in three blocks with mini-quizzes every 3 cards:
```
[1][2][3]‚ÜíQuiz‚Üí[4][5][6]‚ÜíQuiz‚Üí[7][8]‚ÜíFinal
```
This keeps you engaged and tests retention immediately."**

### Live Flash Session
[Start actual flash session]

**"Let me show you a real session. First, the 3-second countdown prepares your brain for focused learning."**

[Show countdown: 3...2...1...]

**"Phase 1: Visual Recognition - just the character for 2-4 seconds."**

[Show character ÊÑõ alone on screen]

**"Your brain focuses purely on visual form without distractions. This creates what we call 'anticipation learning' - you're primed to connect this shape with meaning."**

**"Phase 2: Multi-modal Integration - now we connect all the dots."**

[Show full card: ÊÑõ (√†i) with heart image, "love", and audio playing]

**"Character, pronunciation, image, meaning, and audio all presented simultaneously. This creates multiple memory pathways - visual, auditory, semantic - for maximum retention."**

[Continue through 3 cards, then show mini-quiz]

**"After every 3 characters, a mini-quiz tests immediate retention with intelligent distractors."**

[Show quiz: "Which character means 'love'?" with options including visually similar characters]

**"Notice the distractors aren't random - they're characters that are actually confused with our target character, making this real learning, not just memorization."**

## üî¨ Science-Based Spaced Repetition (45 seconds)

[Show session completion screen]

**"Here's the crucial part most apps miss. High quiz scores right after learning don't equal long-term retention. That's why we implement the SM-2 algorithm for spaced repetition."**

[Show dashboard with "Due Today: 8 characters"]

**"Your brain will forget 70% of what you learned within 24 hours without review. Danbing automatically schedules reviews at the optimal intervals:**
- **Day 1**: First critical review
- **Day 7**: Second reinforcement  
- **Increasing intervals**: Based on your performance"**

[Show analytics graph of memory retention over time]

**"This scientifically-proven approach ensures characters move from short-term working memory into permanent long-term storage."**

## üí° AI-Powered Character Insights (75 seconds)

[Click on a character to open insights modal]

**"This is where Danbing's AI truly shines. Click any character to access deep linguistic analysis that would normally require a Chinese linguistics degree."**

[Show Character Insights modal for ÊÑõ]

**"For the character ÊÑõ (love), our AI provides:**

**Etymology**: 'Originally depicted a person looking back with reluctance, showing emotional attachment'

**Memory Aids**: 'A person (‰∫∫) with a heart (ÂøÉ) in the middle shows love'

**Common Confusions**: 'Âèó (sh√≤u) - 78% confusion risk due to similar radical structure'

**Learning Tips**: Personalized advice based on your learning level and patterns"**

[Scroll through different sections]

**"Notice how Chinese characters throughout the analysis automatically get pinyin annotations. This isn't static content - it's dynamically generated and constantly improving."**

[Show complexity analysis with visual metrics]

**"The AI even analyzes visual complexity, semantic categories, and tone patterns to help you understand why certain characters are harder to remember than others."**

**"This level of insight typically requires expensive tutoring or years of study. Danbing provides it instantly for every character."**

## üìä Analytics & Progress Tracking (45 seconds)

[Navigate to analytics dashboard]

**"Your learning journey is tracked with detailed analytics that help you optimize your study patterns."**

[Show various analytics charts]

**"Track your:**
- **Accuracy trends** over time
- **Response speed** improvements  
- **Confusion patterns** - which characters trip you up
- **Retention rates** by character difficulty
- **Learning velocity** - characters mastered per week"**

[Highlight specific metrics]

**"See this confusion analysis? The system identifies that you're mixing up ÊÑõ and Âèó. It automatically uses these as quiz distractors to strengthen your discrimination between similar characters."**

[Show streak counter and daily goals]

**"Gamification elements like streaks and daily goals maintain motivation, while the underlying spaced repetition algorithm ensures you're always studying the right characters at the right time."**
